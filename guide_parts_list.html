            <p>1. Motherboards</p>
            <li>
                <p>The motherboard is like the body of a computer. Everything is connected to the motherboard. The two important factors to consider
                    buying a motherboard is what processor(CPU) you're planning to get and what features you need. The reason why it's important to know what CPU
                    you're gonna use first is because CPU needs to be compatible with the motherboard. Otherwise the CPU wouldn't fit in the CPU socket and it won't work.
                    PC part picker website is useful for this, as well as additional research on what type of motherboard you would need to use the CPU that you want.</p>

            <button type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#parts-1" class="button button_shadow">â–¼</button>

            <div id="parts-1" class="collapse">
                <li>
                    <p>There are four sizes of motherboards: mini-itx, micro-atx, atx, and eatx. From left to right is smallest to biggest.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                    <p>Mini-Itx: The smallest form for a motherboard, which is good for people with limited space. Mini-itx motherboards have everthing
                        a computer typically needs. But due to the small size, mini-itx offers less features. For instance, they typically have one PCIE-Express x16 lane.
                        This means that you would only be able to fit one GPU. There are also less sata connectors, maximum two RAM slot, so less storage and memory you can have.
                        However, since the micro-itx has less features, it also takes less power to run a micro-itx build. Thus, mini-itx boards offers less features compared to the
                        other forms that motherboard comes in, have everything a normal computer needs and takes less electricity to run.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Micro-Atx: The second smallest type of motherboard. They are more commonly used in comparison to mini-itx. They are slightly smaller than normal atx boards.
                        Unlike mini-itx, micro-atx have more sata ports have maximum of 4 RAM slots, requires more electricity and more PCIE-Express lanes. Micro-Atx boards are better for gaming due to the multiple bonus
                        features.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Atx: Atx motherboards are the standard size when it comes to motherboard. They are the most common type of motherboard you will see in the market. They usually require either
                        4-8pin power-connector, which is more power than the mini-itx and micro-atx boards. Since Atx boards are bigger, there are also more ports and more flexibilty. Overclocking is more
                        do-able/stable. Maximum 4 RAM slots, so more than enough ram slots. Overall, atx boards offers everything a general consumer will need.

                </li>
                </li>

        <p>2. Processor(CPU) and CPU cooler</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                In the picture, the cpu is not visible as it's under the CPU cooler. But they are usually squares about 1.5 inches x 1.5 inches. The size may very from how many cores that they may have.
                Processors are like the brain of a computer. They're responsible for processing everything necessary to run a computer. For CPUs there two main brands: Intel and AMD. Both require different sockets for the motherboard.
                CPU have cores in them, which are responsible for processing data. The more cores means more processing is happen in the same time, which mean that you can multi-task more apps at once. Another thing to conside is the
                the speed of the CPU. CPU that have higher clock speeds are quicker at processing data.
                <br>
                CPU coolers are what cools the CPU. There are three types: Air coolers, All-In-One liquid cooler(AIO) and custom liquid cooling. Air coolers are the easiest to setup and maintain typically. AIO are liquid coolers that have a coolant lquid in them as well as
                a radiator and a pump. Custom liquid cooling have tubing and coolant. The difference between AIO and custom liquid cooling is the required maintence, difficuiltity in assembling it and the price. For AIOs, they come fully built and ready for use.
                But for custom liquid coolers, you need to build it, as they come in as parts for you to assemble.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>3. Random Access Memory (RAM)</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                RAM have two important factors. The amount of RAM (gbs) and the clock speed of them. The amount ram dictates how much you can multi-task at once. The more ram you have the more applications you have open at once.
                The clock speed affects how fast the RAM can perform certain actions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>4. Case Fans</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                Case fans are imprtant in the build as they are responsible for cooling your system. Fan helps circulate the air inside the PC case so that hot air can leave the system as well as cool air come into the system.
                The orientation of the fans matter as the orientation dictates whether the fan is an exhaust fan or an intake fan. Exhaust fans help heat leave the system. Intake fan help cool air come into the system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>5. Case</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                Case is where all the computer parts live in. There are different case sizes depending on what motherboard you have. Mini-itx boards have mini-itx cases, while atx boards have atx cases. A good thing to keep in mind is
                that atx cases are usually compatible with the smaller size motherboards too. So you can match a micro-atx motherboard with an atx case but not vice-versa.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>6. Graphics Card (GPU)</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                GPU are responsible for all the display you see on the screen, as well as the frames per second(FPS) you get in games. They could get expenisive as they get more high-end. The two major companys that make GPUs are
                Nvidia and AMD. Depending on your budget and the purpose of your computer, you may or may not need to spend a lot of money for this computer part. If it's a gaming computer, probably half of your funds is going to be allocated
                to the GPU, otherwise probably not. GPU have a clock speed, memory speed and amount.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>7/8. Hard drive and SSD</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                They both are responsible for storage and storing your data. The difference between the two are their write and read speeds, as well as their cost/per gigabyte. SSDs are typically 10x faster than hard drives, but are more expensive for cost/per gb. In other
                words, its more extensive to get a 1 tb of SSD space than a 1tb of hard drive space. I do recommend getting a ssd with small amount of storage for mainly holding your operating system, as it will significatnly increase your computer's boot times.
                And get a separate hard drive all you files and application, as cost/gb is cheaper for hard drives.

            </p>
        </li>
        <p>9. Power Supply</p>
        <li>
            <p>
                The power supply is responsibly for powering your system. They also four factors to a power supply: brand, watt, type and rating. For brand, go with the reliable brands as they are safer than the unknown brands. The power supply powers your system, so it's also able
                to die and bring your computer components with it. So going with a known brand is more reliable when it comes to power supplys. Wattage is the amount of electricty your power supply can supply. I recoomend getting a power supply a bit more than you need by 200-300 watts, so you can room for
                upgradability in the future. There are three types: non-modular, semi-modular and fully modular. For non-modular power supplys, all the wires from the power supply are fixed, which means that they aren't removable. For semi-modular, it's
                a hybrid as the only cable that can't be removed is the motherboard power cable, but everything else is removable. Lastly, fully modular power supplys have fully detachable wires, which is helpful for cable management. Rating is how electricly efficent your power supply is.
