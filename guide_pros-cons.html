                                    You have the flexibility to choose what computer parts to go into your computer. The beautiful of this is that
                                    you can allocate your budget based on your needs. For instance, if it's a gaming computer, more money would
                                    be allocated to a better graphics card, as they are responsible for the frames per second and how your games look.
                                    Meanwhile, a video-editing computer would focus more on the processor(CPU).

                                    You can have any theme you want for your computer build! For instance, you can do color themes (white/black, black/red),
                                    or you can movie character themes, or anything really!

                                You can upgrade or replace any part of your build when you want or need to. This allows your computer to have a longer lifespan
                                as well as usability.

                                You can buy computer parts when they are on sale, since there usually computer part sales every so often. You also don't need pay
                                for the labor that went to a pre-built computer, since you're building it. Lastly, you could also buy used computer parts. However
                                used computer parts are a bit prone to not working, so be  careful when buying used parts.

                                The whole experience from choosing your computer parts to building it are both fun and nerve-wracking. The computer becomes very personal
                                gadget, since it's built by you. Also, you will learn a lot and gain a better understanding of how computer generally work.

                                Although the individual computer parts may have warranty, the whole computer itself, as a unit, doesn't have warranty. Therefore, there is
                                less insurance when building your own computer. It's also more of a hassle to deal individual computer part warrant vs a single computer warranty.

                                There is a chance of failing to build a computer. But there are a lot of online resources, like youtube videos, that could teach you how to build a
                                computer successfully.
