                    <p>Step 1: Installing processor(CPU) to motherboard</p>
                    <p>
                        First touch to ground yourself by touching the PC case(do this periodically throughout the build process). Next remove the packaging for both the motherboard and CPU and
                        set the motherboard on top of the motherboard packaging box. Then lift the metal lever on the side of the CPU socket and then align the corner triangle of the CPU to the
                        socket's corner triangle. Gently release the CPU which should fall into place snuggly. Make sure to not put any force, as it may bent the pins on the underside of the CPU
                        Wiggle very gently side by side to make sure the CPU is placed in the CPU socket snuggly. Lastly pull down the side lever from the CPU socket's side, you may feel a bit tension,
                        but it's normal. You have successfully installed the CPU onto the motherboard!

                    <p>Step 2: Install the CPU cooler on top of CPU</p>
                    <p>
                        As for how to install the CPU coolers, it depends on which CPU cooler you're gonna use.
                        <br>
                        Stock Coolers: The cooler that comes with some CPUs
                        If it's a stock cooler(the cooler that sometimes comes with CPU), you won't need to worry about applying thermal paste onto the CPU cooler's heatsink, since it'd be already
                        pre-applied. You would simply place the CPU cooler on top of the CPU that's on top of the motherboard, while aligning the four corner holes, as well as making sure your CPU
                        cooler's cable could reach the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard. Then tighten the screw in a cross pattern for equal pressure and plug in the CPU cooler's wire into the CPU fan header.
                        <br>
                        Third Party Coolers/All-In-One Liquid Cooler(AIO): The cooler that you bought separately from another brand.<br>
                        If it's a third part cooler, I recommend reading the manual because third party coolers vary from company to company and the manual should explain how to install it. Also, check if there is thermal paste<br>
                        pre-applied onto CPU cooler before installing it.
                        Same for AIOs, the manual should explain how to install it.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>Step 3: Install the memory (RAM sticks) to motherboard</p>
                    <p>
                        To install the RAM onto the motherboard, first look at the manual to see which memory lanes to use based on the number of RAM stick you're planning to install because there is<br>
                        an order to which lanes you put your first->second->third->fourth RAM stick due to duel channel memory(optimizes the RAM sticks if you have two or four memory sticks). Once you know<br>
                        which lanes to put your RAM sticks into, push the tab down on the top of RAM socket and then insert the RAM stick. This step will require a bit pressure, but once you hear the click<br>
                        you're good.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 4: Install the motherboard into the PC case</p>
                    <p>
                        Before putting your motherboard into the PC case, you will need to put the I/O shield(comes included with the motherboard) into the PC case. This part may be tricky but shouldn't be
                        too difficult. There is a cutout on the back side of your case next to the exhaust fan holes. The cutout is for the I/O shield, so first align the I/O shield and make sure the the I/O
                        orientation is correct(compare orientation of motherboard to I/O shield) and then put pressure on the I/O shield from inside out. You should hear four click from each corner of the I/O shield
                        indicating that you have installed the I/O shield. Then install the screw standoffs onto case using the case standoffs(comes with case). Next gently bring the motherboard down into the case and
                        align the I/O cutouts with the I/O of the motherboard. Make sure that all the holes is align with the screw standoffs we install earlier. If it's not aligned, reinsert the I/O shield, as it may not be
                        fully installed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 5: Install the power supply into the case</p>
                    <p>
                        Before putting the power supply into the case, you may or may not need to do the follow step. If you have a nonmodular power supply(all power cables non-removable from power supply) then you can
                        skip this first step. Else, if you have a semi- or fully- modular power supply, plug in the power cables you will need, like plugging in the motherboard power cable, cpu cable and sata power cable into power supply.
                        The manual should also have labels of which cables you may need.
                        <br>
                        After you have plugged in all the necessary wires, you start putting the power supply into your PC case. Depending on the PC case, the power supply area may be located at the top of the case or at the
                        bottom of the case. Before placing the power supply, make sure the the power supply fan is faced down where the air vents are on the bottom of the case, or face up if your case has a top mount for the power supply.
                        The orientation of the power supply matter as the wrong orientation may cause the power supply to breathe hot air rather than cool air. You can begin screwing the power supply onto the case.

                <li>
                    <p>Step 6: Installing the hard drive(HD)/SSD</p>
                    <p>
                        Remove the hard-drive tray from PC case if you are installing a hard drive and if your case have a hard drive tray. Then screw the hard-drive or SSD onto the tray. Then put the tray back into the PC case.
                        For m.2 SSD, you would need to find the m.2 slot on the motherboard and plug it in, screw it down and then you'll be done. But for hard-drive and normal SSD, there is still one more step. Plug in the power cable and sata cable
                        for HD or SSD.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 7: Plugging in all the case/power supply wires</p>
                    <p>
                        The wires will look intimidating right now, but it not as bad as it may look. Each cable can only plug into one specific socket, so don't worry about plugging cables into the wrong places. But the only wire that may be
                        a bit tricky are the case buttons(power button, reset button). So lets do that first. To plug in the case buttons properly, look at the section of your motherboard manual first, as it should tell you which plug is for which cable. Also,
                        the motherboard may have labeled diagram that shows the orientation of the case button cables. In addition, every cable for the case button is labeled, so follow the manual accordingly. Now, you can plug in your case fans to the case headers
                        on the motherboard. If you have multiple fans, attach them all to your case at the appropriate fan locations in the case. Then make sure to plug in the fan cable to the fan headers that are distributed around your motherboard. Next, you can
                        plug in the sata cable from your hard drive and SSD into the sata ports on your motherboard if you hadn't done so already. Then, plug in your case's usb 3.0 cable, if your cases has one. They usually have a blue-tip, so it should be noticable.
                        Plug the usb 3.0 cable into the slot on the motherboard that has the label USB3.0, or something like that. Repeat the same step for the regular usb 2.0 cable, as they are pretty much same steps. Next plug in your CPU power cable which CPU power
                        socket typically is located at the top left of the motherboard. Then plug in your big motherboard power cable (the 24 pin connector) onto to your motherboard. This step may require force, so be careful as you plug it in. Lastly, if you have a
                        graphics card, unscrew the side screw that holds the covers for the graphics card slot. Find the PCIE express x16 lane, as that lane is for the additions cards (graphic cards, stream cards). Remove the necessary slots and then push down the
                        lever on the PCIE express x16 slot. Push the graphic card into the socket. Make sure to plug in the 6,8,12, or 16 vga power connecter if your graphics card uses additional power.
                        <br>
                        Additional: -plug in your rgb strips to the rgb header of your motherboard and arrange it however you want it to be.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 8: Cable Management (optional, but recommended)</p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you know where every wire is plugged into, you could organize your wire, so that it'll be neatly arranged from both the front and back view. I recommend using zip ties and velcro straps for cable management.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Step 9: First Boot/Installing the OS and drivers
                        You're done with about 90% of the build. Now you need to plug your monitor, keyboard, and mouse into your computer. Plug the power cable from power supply to a wall outlet. Make sure your power supply switch is switched on. Now turn on your monitor and press the power button.
                        If your computer had rgb lights, they should light up now. If not check if you have switched on the power supply in back of your computer. If not check for any loose cables, especially the case button cables. However, if the rgb lights, or other lights from your components light up,
                        it's a good sign. Now wait for your computer to post(display the general specs of the computer and allow you to get into the bios). Once it post, you're good. You can install windows or linux onto your computer. Once you've installed your OS, you can install your drivers from your motherboard's manufacture
                        website. There you can download the drivers and latest bios. I recommend flashing your bios(updating your bios) but it's not mandatory. Install all of your applications and you're done :D!
